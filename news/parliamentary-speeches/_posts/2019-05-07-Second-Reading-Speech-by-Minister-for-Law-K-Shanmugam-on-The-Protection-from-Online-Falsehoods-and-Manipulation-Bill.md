**<u>Introduction</u>**

1. This Bill comes after a long process of public consultation, beginning on the 5th of January 2018. A Green Paper by the Ministry of Law, as well as the Ministry of Communications and Information, highlighted the serious nature of the issues, and the significant impact in other countries.

2. On 5 January 2018, we asked Parliament and Parliament did so appoint a Select Committee to examine four broad issues. The Select Committee, which I will call the “SC”, held public hearings, received 169 written representations, from a broad cross-section of society. The SC then prepared a detailed, 279-page Report.

<ol start="3">
<li>Many of the issues which have been raised since the Bill was first tabled in Parliament, repeat points which were canvassed quite extensively during the SC hearings.  Points like:
  
<ul>
<li>falsehoods and how to define them, how to differentiate them from opinions</li>
<li>the possible different decision-making models – like Executive powers, Independent body, Courts</li>
</ul>
– and other such points.
</li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
4. Some of the discussion since the Bill has been tabled, I think, has not considered what the SC has said, or the evidence that had been presented, and the balancing between different interests that the SC had to do. I hope the discussions in this House will be better informed by reference to the SC’s Report.

<ol start="5">
<li>In this speech, I will:
<ol>
<li>First, explain the existing powers in law, for dealing with objectionable material, and contrast that with the powers under the Bill</li>
<li>Second, why the Bill is being brought before this House now.</li>
<li>Third, the need and rationale for the Bill</li>
<li>Fourth, New Media and the weaponisation of falsehoods</li>
<li>Fifth, deal with some of the concerns that have been expressed,</li>
</ol>
-        and finally conclude.
</li>  
</ol>

{:start="6"}
6. My colleagues, Minister Iswaran and Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong, will deal with the key provisions of the Bill and how they implement the SC’s recommendations. Minister Ong Ye Kung will speak on the Universities. My colleagues, Minister of State Zaqy and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling, will also speak in addition to other Members.

</ol>


{:start="7"}
7. First, the powers that the Government has under existing legislation, they are wider than what is proposed under this Bill.

{:start="8"}
8. As we consider the Bill, the first question is: what are the Government’s powers under existing legislation? And, what can the Government do about objectionable material now? In essential respects, existing powers are wider than those proposed under the Bill.

<ol start="9">
<li>Let me return to the current legislation. We can refer to the Broadcasting Act, the Telecommunications Act and various other pieces of legislation. Collectively, they give the following powers:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>They allow orders to be made for Take Down of any material that is objectionable, on grounds of public interest.
<br>
The statements do not have to be factual, or false. They can be true; they can be opinions. They can nevertheless be ordered to be taken down, under the current law.
</li>
<li>  Current laws also criminalize the transmission of false or fabricated messages, including on the internet.</li>
<li>Licensed newspapers, broadcasters, including on the Internet, can be required to carry clarifications and other content.</li>
<li>The Minister can make orders to restrict financing, technical support, to offending websites and restrict their reach, can block offending websites and access to objectionable material.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

{:start="10"}
10. Section 16 of the Broadcasting Act allows IMDA to direct a broadcasting licensee to “take such action” with regard to content, as it considers necessary to comply with the Act.


{:start="11"}
11. Some of these powers have existed since the 1960s. Others were added on subsequently, with the development of technology. Laws have been updated, many of these powers also apply to online material.
 

{:start="12"} 
12. The Internet revolution took off in the 1990s. In 1996, the Class Licensing Scheme under the Broadcasting Act for Internet Content Providers was put in place. The Internet Content Providers (ICPs) are automatically licensed. All have to comply with guidelines under the Class Licence Conditions and the Internet Code of Practice. IMDA has power to take down content that goes against, and I quote, “public interest, public order, national harmony,” amongst other grounds.
 

{:start="13"} 
13. In 2013, then-MDA put in place a new individual licensing scheme for news websites which report regularly on Singapore. It required online news sites to remove within 24 hours content which was in breach of standards, and post a performance bond of $50,000. The new regime harmonised the legal framework for online news sites with the framework for traditional news providers.
 
 
{:start="14"}
14. At that point in 2013, Members will recall, some persons created the “Hands Off My Internet” movement, “Free My Internet” Rally in Hong Lim. Some painted doomsday scenarios, how there is going to be a “chilling effect on free speech”, death of free speech and so on. Online statements were circulated asking netizens to “take a strong stand against the licensing regime”. There was an online petition as well.

{:start="15"}
15. All of that had little to do with the truth. Prior to the 2013 regulations, online news sites already had to comply with the same content standards. So there was no change in content standards.
 
{:start="16"}
16. Post 2013, discussions online carried on as before. So, from 1996 to 2019, 23 years that you have had the Class Licence scheme, take-downs were used mostly for sites and services with pornographic content, solicitation of sex, sex chats, religiously-offensive content, extremist content. Most people in the street don’t even know of the BA, or other legislation, and it has no impact on what they have been saying. The powers under the BA, have been used judiciously and discussions have carried on as before.

{:start="17"}
17. The arguments made in 2013, against the changes, are similar to the arguments that are being made now, and I will explain that later. They also have no connection to reality.
 
 
{:start="18"}
18. I will now make the point that the Bill provides for narrower set of powers, compared with powers that the Government already has. This is an important point, when we make philosophical arguments in this House.

<ol start="19">
<li>Earlier, I sketched out the existing powers and I have said the Bill is narrower in essential respects because it only applies to false statements of fact. In addition, it must be shown that the falsehoods are against public interest – which is set out in some detail in the Bill. The four aspects of the Bill that have been commented upon by those who are opposed:
<ol>
<li>Take down of material,</li>
<li>Take Down can be ordered by Ministers,</li>
<li>Definition of Public Interest,</li>
<li>Definition of falsehoods.</li>
</ol>
I will deal quickly with all four.
</li>
</ol>

{:start="20"}
20. First point: the BA is broader on the types of material that can be taken down. The Bill is narrower. IMDA can direct licensees to remove content. It has the power to impose further obligations on licensees through their licensing conditions, to correct falsehoods or shut down fake accounts. IMDA can also require a licensee to carry any correction as directed.
 
{:start="21"} 
21. Second point: The powers under the BA are exercised by the Minister today. There is no direct appeal to the Court. It is only by judicial review.
 
{:start="22"} 
22. Third point: Public Interest. The definition under the current law is wider, and the grounds for taking action are also broader. Any statement, whether true or false, factual or opinion, if it is objectionable against public interest, national harmony, can be ordered to be taken down, subject to judicial review. The Bill is much narrower.

<ol start="23">
<li>Fourth point: Falsehoods – how do you define? Dealing with falsehoods is not new.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Section 45 of Telecommunications Act (TA) criminalises falsehoods, transmitted over the Internet and other modes.</li>
<li>And the Courts have long had to deal with question of falsehoods, in the law of torts, contracts, criminal law.</li>
Section 45 of the TA was repealed yesterday, subsumed under the MOA and the Penal Code. And the relevant provision on transmitting falsehoods is now in Section 14D of the MOA, without any change. It has just been transported over.
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<ol start="24">
<li>So some of the discussions by those opposed to this Bill, fails to consider what the SC Report has said. And seems to be without an understanding of the existing position.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">
<li>Bill gives greater judicial oversight</li>
</ol>

{:start="25"}
25. Let me now deal with the second point, it is not just narrower in scope, but it also gives greater judicial oversight, compared to the current law.
 
{:start="26"} 
26. Existing powers on take down of objectionable material, the government responses to be carried, other orders to be made, what oversight does the Court have today? It is by judicial review.

<ol start="27">
<li>According to the Bill:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>On the determination of falsehoods, the Court oversight is by way of direct appeal. That was a considered decision by the Government. And the process will be made fast and inexpensive, for individuals.</li>
<li>Other exercise of Government powers under the Bill, judicial review will be available, as is the law now.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="28"}
28. So whatever concerns there are about the Bill, they cannot logically have been increased by this Bill. Lawyers will know, when you have a narrower Bill, and the facts come within the narrower Bill, as opposed to the broader law in general, the narrower Act will apply. So in fact it represents a narrowing of the current position.

<ol start="29">
<li>So as Members speak, I hope the debate will be based on an understanding of the current position. And I will do that by putting a series of questions.

<ol>
<li>Does the current law already criminalize transmission of falsehoods? The answer is yes. Does the Bill take a narrower position? Answer is yes. So these arguments about definition of fact: These concerns cannot be new. We had similar provisions all this while with less judicial oversight. How does the bill increase the concerns?</li>
<li>Second, Take Downs, Corrections, are they possible now? Answer is yes.</li>
<li>Third, can a Minister order take downs now? Answer is yes.</li>
<li>Fourth, can a Minister order take downs on broader grounds than under the Bill? The answer is yes.</li>
<li>Fifth, does the Bill give greater judicial oversight? Answer is yes.  </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">
<li>Why not rely on existing legislation?</li>
</ol>

{:start="30"}
30. So having said that, Members can then ask: If the power is narrower in these essential respects, why introduce this legislation? Why not just rely on existing legislation?
