**<u>Introduction</u>**

1. This Bill comes after a long process of public consultation, beginning on the 5th of January 2018. A Green Paper by the Ministry of Law, as well as the Ministry of Communications and Information, highlighted the serious nature of the issues, and the significant impact in other countries.

2. On 5 January 2018, we asked Parliament and Parliament did so appoint a Select Committee to examine four broad issues. The Select Committee, which I will call the “SC”, held public hearings, received 169 written representations, from a broad cross-section of society. The SC then prepared a detailed, 279-page Report.

<ol start="3">
<li>Many of the issues which have been raised since the Bill was first tabled in Parliament, repeat points which were canvassed quite extensively during the SC hearings.  Points like:
  
<ul>
<li>falsehoods and how to define them, how to differentiate them from opinions</li>
<li>the possible different decision-making models – like Executive powers, Independent body, Courts</li>
</ul>
– and other such points.
</li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
4. Some of the discussion since the Bill has been tabled, I think, has not considered what the SC has said, or the evidence that had been presented, and the balancing between different interests that the SC had to do. I hope the discussions in this House will be better informed by reference to the SC’s Report.

<ol start="5">
<li>In this speech, I will:
<ol>
<li>First, explain the existing powers in law, for dealing with objectionable material, and contrast that with the powers under the Bill</li>
<li>Second, why the Bill is being brought before this House now.</li>
<li>Third, the need and rationale for the Bill</li>
<li>Fourth, New Media and the weaponisation of falsehoods</li>
<li>Fifth, deal with some of the concerns that have been expressed,</li>
</ol>
-        and finally conclude.
</li>  
</ol>

{:start="6"}
6. My colleagues, Minister Iswaran and Senior Minister of State Edwin Tong, will deal with the key provisions of the Bill and how they implement the SC’s recommendations. Minister Ong Ye Kung will speak on the Universities. My colleagues, Minister of State Zaqy and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Sun Xueling, will also speak in addition to other Members.

<li><u>Comparison with Existing Law</u></li>
</ol>


<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li style="font-style:italic">
Existing powers are wider than the Bill’s proposed powers
</li>
</ol>


{:start="7"}
7. First, the powers that the Government has under existing legislation, they are wider than what is proposed under this Bill.

{:start="8"}
8. As we consider the Bill, the first question is: what are the Government’s powers under existing legislation? And, what can the Government do about objectionable material now? In essential respects, existing powers are wider than those proposed under the Bill.

<ol start="9">
<li>Let me return to the current legislation. We can refer to the Broadcasting Act, the Telecommunications Act and various other pieces of legislation. Collectively, they give the following powers:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>They allow orders to be made for Take Down of any material that is objectionable, on grounds of public interest.
<br>
The statements do not have to be factual, or false. They can be true; they can be opinions. They can nevertheless be ordered to be taken down, under the current law.
</li>
<li>  Current laws also criminalize the transmission of false or fabricated messages, including on the internet.</li>
<li>Licensed newspapers, broadcasters, including on the Internet, can be required to carry clarifications and other content.</li>
<li>The Minister can make orders to restrict financing, technical support, to offending websites and restrict their reach, can block offending websites and access to objectionable material.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

{:start="10"}
10. Section 16 of the Broadcasting Act allows IMDA to direct a broadcasting licensee to “take such action” with regard to content, as it considers necessary to comply with the Act.


{:start="11"}
11. Some of these powers have existed since the 1960s. Others were added on subsequently, with the development of technology. Laws have been updated, many of these powers also apply to online material.
 

{:start="12"} 
12. The Internet revolution took off in the 1990s. In 1996, the Class Licensing Scheme under the Broadcasting Act for Internet Content Providers was put in place. The Internet Content Providers (ICPs) are automatically licensed. All have to comply with guidelines under the Class Licence Conditions and the Internet Code of Practice. IMDA has power to take down content that goes against, and I quote, “public interest, public order, national harmony,” amongst other grounds.
 

{:start="13"} 
13. In 2013, then-MDA put in place a new individual licensing scheme for news websites which report regularly on Singapore. It required online news sites to remove within 24 hours content which was in breach of standards, and post a performance bond of $50,000. The new regime harmonised the legal framework for online news sites with the framework for traditional news providers.
 
 
{:start="14"}
14. At that point in 2013, Members will recall, some persons created the “Hands Off My Internet” movement, “Free My Internet” Rally in Hong Lim. Some painted doomsday scenarios, how there is going to be a “chilling effect on free speech”, death of free speech and so on. Online statements were circulated asking netizens to “take a strong stand against the licensing regime”. There was an online petition as well.

{:start="15"}
15. All of that had little to do with the truth. Prior to the 2013 regulations, online news sites already had to comply with the same content standards. So there was no change in content standards.
 
{:start="16"}
16. Post 2013, discussions online carried on as before. So, from 1996 to 2019, 23 years that you have had the Class Licence scheme, take-downs were used mostly for sites and services with pornographic content, solicitation of sex, sex chats, religiously-offensive content, extremist content. Most people in the street don’t even know of the BA, or other legislation, and it has no impact on what they have been saying. The powers under the BA, have been used judiciously and discussions have carried on as before.

{:start="17"}
17. The arguments made in 2013, against the changes, are similar to the arguments that are being made now, and I will explain that later. They also have no connection to reality.
 
 
{:start="18"}
18. I will now make the point that the Bill provides for narrower set of powers, compared with powers that the Government already has. This is an important point, when we make philosophical arguments in this House.

<ol start="19">
<li>Earlier, I sketched out the existing powers and I have said the Bill is narrower in essential respects because it only applies to false statements of fact. In addition, it must be shown that the falsehoods are against public interest – which is set out in some detail in the Bill. The four aspects of the Bill that have been commented upon by those who are opposed:
<ol>
<li>Take down of material,</li>
<li>Take Down can be ordered by Ministers,</li>
<li>Definition of Public Interest,</li>
<li>Definition of falsehoods.</li>
</ol>
I will deal quickly with all four.
</li>
</ol>

{:start="20"}
20. First point: the BA is broader on the types of material that can be taken down. The Bill is narrower. IMDA can direct licensees to remove content. It has the power to impose further obligations on licensees through their licensing conditions, to correct falsehoods or shut down fake accounts. IMDA can also require a licensee to carry any correction as directed.
 
{:start="21"} 
21. Second point: The powers under the BA are exercised by the Minister today. There is no direct appeal to the Court. It is only by judicial review.
 
{:start="22"} 
22. Third point: Public Interest. The definition under the current law is wider, and the grounds for taking action are also broader. Any statement, whether true or false, factual or opinion, if it is objectionable against public interest, national harmony, can be ordered to be taken down, subject to judicial review. The Bill is much narrower.

<ol start="23">
<li>Fourth point: Falsehoods – how do you define? Dealing with falsehoods is not new.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Section 45 of Telecommunications Act (TA) criminalises falsehoods, transmitted over the Internet and other modes.</li>
<li>And the Courts have long had to deal with question of falsehoods, in the law of torts, contracts, criminal law.</li>
Section 45 of the TA was repealed yesterday, subsumed under the MOA and the Penal Code. And the relevant provision on transmitting falsehoods is now in Section 14D of the MOA, without any change. It has just been transported over.
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<ol start="24">
<li>So some of the discussions by those opposed to this Bill, fails to consider what the SC Report has said. And seems to be without an understanding of the existing position.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">
<li>Bill gives greater judicial oversight</li>
</ol>

{:start="25"}
25. Let me now deal with the second point, it is not just narrower in scope, but it also gives greater judicial oversight, compared to the current law.
 
{:start="26"} 
26. Existing powers on take down of objectionable material, the government responses to be carried, other orders to be made, what oversight does the Court have today? It is by judicial review.

<ol start="27">
<li>According to the Bill:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>On the determination of falsehoods, the Court oversight is by way of direct appeal. That was a considered decision by the Government. And the process will be made fast and inexpensive, for individuals.</li>
<li>Other exercise of Government powers under the Bill, judicial review will be available, as is the law now.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="28"}
28. So whatever concerns there are about the Bill, they cannot logically have been increased by this Bill. Lawyers will know, when you have a narrower Bill, and the facts come within the narrower Bill, as opposed to the broader law in general, the narrower Act will apply. So in fact it represents a narrowing of the current position.

<ol start="29">
<li>So as Members speak, I hope the debate will be based on an understanding of the current position. And I will do that by putting a series of questions.

<ol>
<li>Does the current law already criminalize transmission of falsehoods? The answer is yes. Does the Bill take a narrower position? Answer is yes. So these arguments about definition of fact: These concerns cannot be new. We had similar provisions all this while with less judicial oversight. How does the bill increase the concerns?</li>
<li>Second, Take Downs, Corrections, are they possible now? Answer is yes.</li>
<li>Third, can a Minister order take downs now? Answer is yes.</li>
<li>Fourth, can a Minister order take downs on broader grounds than under the Bill? The answer is yes.</li>
<li>Fifth, does the Bill give greater judicial oversight? Answer is yes.  </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">
<li>Why not rely on existing legislation?</li>
</ol>

{:start="30"}
30. So having said that, Members can then ask: If the power is narrower in these essential respects, why introduce this legislation? Why not just rely on existing legislation?


<ol start="31">
<li>The existing legislation, with broad powers, have been in place for some time. After the SC process, we decided to have new legislation:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>with a narrower set of powers than under existing legislation,</li>
<li>focused on online falsehoods with remedies that are calibrated, and</li> 
<li>provide for greater judicial oversight over Executive action,</li>
</ol>
    
</li>  
</ol>

{:start="32"}
32. The Bill is designed specifically for the Internet rather than relying on existing legislation, and to deal specifically with online falsehoods rather than the broader areas that are covered under the BA.

<ol start="33">
<li>An alternate approach was entirely possible, which would be to rely on existing legislation, with slight tweaks and add subsidiary legislation. If we relied on existing legislation, what we want to achieve under this Bill can be achieved as follows.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First, we can rely on the BA as it is now, for Correction Directions, Takedown Directions, General Correction Directions, and demonetisation to some extent.</li> 
<li>Section 16 of the BA allows IMDA to direct a licensee to “take such action” with regard to content as it considers necessary to comply with the Act. So that will be the BA, and then you have subsidiary legislation under the BA, which can be passed with Account Restriction Directions, Declaration of Online location, advertising levers.</li>
<li>Then we move on to the existing Class Licence scheme which can also be amended through subsidiary legislation, to cover provision of content by individual publishers, and clarify that internet intermediaries like Facebook and Google are also covered.
<br>
So all of this, could have been done, under subsidiary legislation.
  
</li>
<li>The only thing that would have required a statutory amendment, would have been one point under the Broadcasting Act: to the territoriality provision, to include internet intermediaries based outside of Singapore. But that really is not in dispute. I don’t think anyone in this House will say we should not cover internet intermediaries based outside Singapore.</li>
</ol>  
  
</li>  
</ol>

{:start="34"}
34. If we had taken this alternate approach, the powers would have been broad and there would be less judicial oversight. Issues that have been raised - Fact versus Falsehoods, Public Interest, Ministerial action, all, -  there would be no amendments needed for the legislation. We can rely on existing legislation. 
 
{:start="35"} 
35. Members can therefore see, if we had relied on existing legislation with the appropriate amendments - and if you map that against the issues that have been raised in public: Fact versus Falsehoods, Public Interest, Ministerial action to take down, there would have been no need to amend.
 
{:start="36"} 
36. If we had taken that approach, the result would have been a blunt instrument, with none of the calibration that the Bill proposes or the extent of judicial oversight, which is also going to be made speedier under the current proposals.
 
{:start="37"} 
37. The BA was essential at its time, to achieve the objective of that Act. It provides a balanced framework applicable to all forms of broadcast content.
 
{:start="38"} 
38. The Bill on the other hand was fashioned to deal specifically with falsehoods that can be spread online with incredible speed, in a targeted manner, and to address such falsehoods, with speed, with proportionality, and with the Courts given greater powers.
 
{:start="39"}
39. That is why the Bill is preferable. That explains the background.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li><u>Need and Rationale for the Bill</u></li>  
</ol>


{:start="40"}
40. What is the need and rationale for the Bill, what are the substantive reasons for the Bill?

<ol start="41">
<li>To understand that, we need to look at this larger context. Trends around the world affecting –
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>the very foundations of democracy,</li>  
<li>seriously impacting societies,</li>
<li>affecting free flow of ideas, honest discussions, and</li>
<li>strangling the marketplace of ideas.</li>
</ol>  
</li>  
</ol>

{:start="42"}
42. This Bill is an attempt to deal with some of these very real, serious risks which all societies face. But at the same time, in a carefully considered manner, with the government deciding that we should come before the House, and put forward something that in a way cuts down on the existing powers. And put forward a new Bill that actually restricts government’s powers compared with today, but focused on online falsehoods. And voluntarily, compared with existing legislation, say, if the House agrees, let us give greater oversight to the judges, and let us make it much faster. So that is the true nature of the exercise.
 
{:start="43"} 
43. But the Bill is not a silver bullet. It cannot address all the issues.
 
{:start="44"} 
44. I will ask Members to bear with me as I set this out because it is important for both Members, and the public, to understand the larger picture before we can understand why this Bill is necessary.
 
{:start="45"} 
45. The SC dealt with a part of the issue, but if you take one step back, what is the fundamental problem in many countries today? It is really a serious loss of trust in Governments, in institutions which are both public and private, including the political system, the media, the professions, businesses, financial institutions and so on.


<ol start="46">
<li>What is the reason for the loss of trust? Several factors, I will mention four.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
 
<li>First, inequality and inequity</li> 
<li>Second, political systems not delivering.<br>
These developments have been aided by at least two other factors –
</li>
<li>The way traditional media has been behaving, and</li>
<li>Effect of New Media.</li>
</ol>  
  
</li>  
</ol>  

{:start="47"}
47. This loss of trust, in turn has led to destructive populism, in many countries, with serious consequences for democracies.
 
{:start="48"} 
48. I will ask Members to bear with me as I explain each because what we are facing, is a very serious situation, across the world, and we will face it. This is not something to be taken lightly. I think the very seriousness of what we are facing, what many other countries in the world are facing, has to be understood. Not just this legislation, but everything that we are going to do, as a Parliament, as a Government, as a society hereafter, has got to be seen in the context of what is happening.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">
<li>Trust</li>  
</ol>

{:start="49"}
49. First, trust.

{:start="50"}
50. Trust in institutions is important for society’s well-being and prosperity.

<ol start="51">
<li>These are institutions that deliver public goods for society:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The Executive,</li>  
<li>Parliament,</li>
<li>The Courts,</li>
<li>Army,</li>
<li>Police,</li>
<li>and other institutions like:
<ul>
<li>media,</li>
<li>healthcare system,</li>
<li>banks,</li>
<li>professions,</li>
<li>universities.</li>
</ul> 
  
</li>
</ol>  
  
</li>  
</ol>  

{:start="52"}
52.  Institutions are the building blocks of democratic societies. People depend on institutions to deliver economic and societal benefits.
 
{:start="53"} 
53.  Institutions play a crucial stabilising role. They serve to manage diversity, hold communities together, keep extremist politics at bay.


<ol start="54">
<li>Institutions, in turn, depend on trust and legitimacy to work, to –
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>persuade the public to make sacrifices for the common good</li>  
<li>encourage societies to cooperate and come together, to solve problems,  </li>
<li>implement policies successfully,</li>
<li>take action for society’s benefit, and</li>
<li>steer countries through crises</li>
</ol> 
</li>  
</ol>  

{:start="55"}
55. When people lose trust in institutions, that creates a vicious cycle. Studies show for example, low trust in the medical system has an impact on public health - management of disease outbreaks. Take law enforcement – perceived legitimacy of police is crucial to effective law enforcement. We can give examples in all sectors.
 
{:start="56"} 
56. But the basic point is, when trust in institutions is lost, society suffers, everyone suffers.


<ol start="57">
<li>What is the situation in the West, in many countries? In Western democracies, trust in governments is falling, significantly.
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li>Europe: the percentage of Europeans who trust their national governments has fallen from 36% to 29% over the last ten years. There is a decline in nearly all countries in Europe.  </li>
<li>US: In the United States, a 2018 Pew Research Center study shows public trust at “near historic lows”. In 2019, only 17% trust the Government. The percentage of Americans with “a great deal of confidence” in the Courts? 16%. 45% do not have much confidence. In the Presidency, 19% have great deal of confidence. 54% have not much confidence.  Americans have the least confidence in Congress, their Parliament, 8% have a great deal of confidence, 71% not much confidence.</li>
</ol> 
  
</li>  
</ol> 


{:start="58"}
58. Trust in other important public institutions is also falling. In the media, medical profession, legal profession, many others. And it is all borne out by data. 

<ol start="59">
<li>Singapore in comparison so far is OK.  We were first included in the Edelman Trust Barometer in 2011.
<ul>
<li>Trust in Government has been good. We have been in the top “Trust” category and the Government is one of the most trusted institutions in Singapore. Trust in Government in 2019 was at 67 points, compared to average of 26 countries at 47.</li>  
<li>Trust in mainstream media, we are 7th out of 26 countries.</li>
</ul>  
</li>  
</ol>  

{:start="60"}
60.  But we cannot ignore the global risks.  And we are likely to be impacted by the same forces.
 
{:start="61"} 
61.  Loss of trust in America has been described by the Wall Street Journal as “not merely a problem, but a crisis.” It speaks to a loss of trust in the political system as a whole, and in democracy itself. What has led to this loss of trust? I highlighted four factors amongst several, let me touch on them briefly.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; font-style: italic">
<li>Rising inequality, inequity</li>  
</ol>  


<ol start="62">
  <li>First: rising inequality, inequity in many parts of the world.
  
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
  <li>If you take the US, the top 0.1% of US households hold the same amount of wealth as the bottom 90%. In US, the average salary of a CEO is 354 times the average salary of a worker.</li>
  <li>In the UK, on the eve of Brexit, UK reached its wealthiest position in its modern history. Yet in the previous two years, the overall wealth of the poorest 20% of UK households declined by 9%.</li>
  <li>It is a global problem. 70% of people live in a country that has seen a rise in inequality in the last 30 years. By 2030 it is estimated that the richest 1% could own two-thirds of the global wealth.</li>
  </ol>
  
  </li>
</ol>  

{:start="63"}
63. So that is one part, inequality, it is a very serious issue. And it is an issue in Singapore as well.

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; ">
  <li>Political systems not delivering</li>  
</ol>  

{:start="64"}
64. Second, political systems not delivering.
 
{:start="65"} 
65. In absolute terms, living standards in most countries have risen compared with previous generations. But absolute numbers are just one part of the picture – you have to look at the reality of people’s lives.
 
{:start="66"} 
66. People’s lives are not improving. Three indicators amongst many – social mobility, quality of public education, jobs.
 
{:start="67"} 
67. Social mobility in the world’s richest countries has stalled since the 1990s. As of 2018, in the UK it took five generations, about 150 years for a child from the bottom 10% in terms of income to reach the average national income. In France, in Germany, it took six generations, 180 years.
 
{:start="68"} 
68. In the US, the public education system, the serious deficiencies have been documented. And low investments in public education is one reason for lower social mobility.

<ol start="69">
<li>So people lose faith in democracy as a whole. People give up, they give up on governments, they don’t think governments can deliver. US, Australia, UK, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and other countries: the percentage of people who say that it is “essential” to live in a democracy has fallen significantly, especially amongst the young.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Less than one-third of Americans below the age of 35, say it is absolutely important to live in a democracy.</li>
<li>From 1995 to 2017, the share of French, Germans, and Italians who favoured military rule went up more than 3 times.</li>
<li>From 1995 to 2014, the share of Americans who favoured military rule rose 2.5 times, from 1 in 16 to 1 in 6. Imagine that, 1 in 6. In America. </li>
</ol>
  
</li>  
</ol>

{:start="70"}
70. So the desire for an upending of the status quo has serious consequences, de-stabilisation, global effects. Democracy itself is under serious threat. It will be very unwise for us to watch and do nothing because it can sweep us over very quickly.
 
{:start="71"} 
71. I believe we are at one of those crucial turning points in history. it may not quite be Gotterdammerung, but a turn for worse.
 
{:start="72"} 
72. This weakening of democracy and institutions has been powered by a series of contributing factors. I will mention two. Media and New Media.


<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">
<li>Media</li>
</ol>

{:start="73"}
73. First, the media. Media has, in other countries, played a highly corrosive role, in eroding trust in many ways.
 
{:start="74"} 
74. In Australia, media played a major role in the ousting former Australian Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull. Media attacked Malcolm Turnbull savagely and regularly, because a media owner didn’t agree with Turnbull’s government policies, in particular on climate change. And Media became an active participant in politics and decided outcomes.
 
{:start="75"} 
7785. As he was being ousted, Turnbull said and I quote: “The reality is that a minority in the party room, supported by others outside the Parliament, have sought to bully, intimidate others into making this change of leadership that they’re seeking”.
 
{:start="76"} 
76. Kevin Rudd, another former Prime Minister, was also ousted by the media. He wrote a scathing article and said, Rupert Murdoch ran a campaign to destroy his government in the 2013 elections. Murdoch’s papers began attacking Rudd because Rudd planned to build a National Broadband Network that would be good for Australia, but Murdoch’s cable monopoly would face greater competition. So Rudd was ousted.
 
{:start="77"} 
77. Rudd described Murdoch as “the greatest cancer of the Australian democracy”, and I quote, “A political bully and a thug who for many years has hired bullies as his editors. The message to Australian politicians is clear: either toe the line on what Murdoch wants or he kills you politically.” He described, and I quote, “a cowering, fearful political culture across the country”. Fear of personal repercussions, if you challenged Murdoch’s interests, and said that Murdoch’s print media had “a disproportionate impact on setting the day’s overall agenda”, using a “masterful conflation of ‘opinion’ with ‘news’”. Such media environment erodes trust in Government.
 
{:start="78"} 
78. If you look at Britain, the baleful influence of Media in British politics is well documented. Look at a Guardian report in 2011. It said Blair “paid court” to Murdoch, securing Murdoch’s patronage, Murdoch gave Blair the power to shut out detractors, used his newspapers to help Blair beat down his rival, Brown. Brown, on the other hand, used the Daily Mail as a platform.
 
{:start="79"} 
79. Murdoch was opposed to the EU. When asked why, Murdoch reportedly said: “When I go into Downing Street they do what I say; When I go to Brussels they take no notice.” Murdoch has since denied saying it. But the City Editor of The Times, Hilton, has stood by his account of what Murdoch said to him.
 
{:start="80"} 
80. Kevin Rudd made the point that “Murdoch made Brexit possible because of the position taken by his papers.” Not just Murdoch’s newspapers, others as well.
