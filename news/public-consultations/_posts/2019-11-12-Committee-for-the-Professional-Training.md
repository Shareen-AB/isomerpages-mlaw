Public Consultation on Proposals to Implement the Recommendations of the Committee for the Professional Training
---

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold">
<li><u>INTRODUCTION</u></li>
</ol>


1. The Ministry of Law invites members of the public to provide feedback on the proposals to implement the recommendations of the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers (“CPTL”) available at

 

2. The CPTL was set up by the Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in August 2016 to conduct a root-and-branch review of the professional training regime and to make recommendations on how it might be modified to raise the quality and consistency of training standards across law practices. The Committee was chaired by Justice Quentin Loh and comprised 14 members including representatives from the Supreme Court, the Attorney-General’s Chambers, MinLaw, the Law Society of Singapore, the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association and various Singapore law practices.

 

3. In August 2018, MinLaw announced that it had accepted in-principle the CPTL’s recommendations and that implementation of the key changes would take place from the 2023 session of Part B examinations onwards. The CPTL made three key structural recommendations:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Uncouple the call to the Bar from the right to practise as a lawyer.</li>
<li>Raise the standard and stringency of the Part B examinations.</li>
<li>Lengthen the practice training period from six months to one year.</li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
4. In addition, the CPTL also made 17 other specific recommendations to support the new professional training regime.

<li><u>Key issues for public consultation</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="5"}
5. A Working Group, comprising representatives from the Ministry of Law, the Singapore Institute of Legal Education, the Supreme Court of Singapore, and the Law Society of Singapore, was set up to implement and operationalise the CPTL’s recommendations
 
{:start="6"}
6. In working out the implementation details, the Working Group has identified the following key issues for public consultation.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>The nomenclature for the new group of individuals who will be admitted to the Bar without having completed their practice training;</li>
<li>The rights conferred to trainees under the new practice training regime;</li>
<li>The moratorium date prior to which law students should not be permitted to apply for practice training contracts; and</li>
<li>The criteria for the in-house legal departments that will be permitted to provide practice training for up to three months, and when trainees can complete this training during the PTP.</li>


<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold">
<li><u>Invitation for feedback</u></li>
</ol>

<li><u>KEY FEATURES OF PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS</u></li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold;">
<li>   SCOPE OF CFA FRAMEWORK</li>
</ol>

{:start="7"}
7. MinLaw proposes to enact through legislative amendments, a legal framework for CFAs to be entered into in relation to international and domestic arbitration proceedings, certain prescribed proceedings in the SICC, including mediation proceedings arising out of or in any way connected with such proceedings. This will align the prospective CFA framework with the third party funding framework (once expanded), to better serve the needs of commercial parties and their counsel.

 
{:start="8"}
8. Under the framework, CFAs would be available in addition to traditional options for payment of legal fees, for the prescribed categories of proceedings.

 
{:start="9"}
9. A separate study will be conducted on whether CFAs will promote access to justice for categories of proceedings that are presently not being considered under the CFA framework.

{:start="10"}
10. **MinLaw seeks your views on the proposal to introduce CFAs, and the present categories of proceedings where CFAs will be permitted.**


<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold;">
<li> MODALITY OF INTRODUCING CFA FRAMEWORK</li>
</ol>


{:start="11"}
11. The proposed framework will be housed under a Civil Law (Amendment) Bill (“the Bill”), in a similar manner as the framework for third party funding.  The Bill will provide that in prescribed categories of dispute resolution proceedings, CFAs are not contrary to public policy or otherwise illegal by reason only that they are contracts for maintenance or champerty <sup>[4]</sup>. The Legal Profession Act will also be amended such that a solicitor who enters into a CFA with a client will not fall foul of the relevant restrictions.


<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold;">
<li>CONDITIONS / SAFEGUARDS</li>
</ol>

<ol start="12">
<li>The proposed framework will provide safeguards which CFAs will be subject to. The following requirements are currently under consideration: <br /> <em>General formalities </em>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>That the CFA be in writing and signed by the client <sup>[5]</sup>;</li>
<li>That the client be fully informed of the nature and operation of the CFA <sup>[6]</sup> and confirm that he has been told of his right to seek independent legal advice before entering into the agreement. <sup>[7]</sup></li>
</ol>
  <i>Inclusion of mandatory terms in CFA </i>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="3">
<li>The provision of a &ldquo;cooling off period&rdquo; during which the client may by written notice terminate the agreement <sup>[8]</sup>;</li>
<li>Parties&rsquo; definition of what constitutes a &ldquo;successful outcome&rdquo; <sup>[9]</sup>;</li>
<li>If there is an uplift or success fee, to state the basis of calculation of the uplift fee <sup>[10]</sup> and provide an estimate or a range of estimates of the resulting quantum of uplift or success fee <sup>[11]</sup>;</li>
<li>Acknowledgement by the client of the client&rsquo;s continued liability for any costs orders that may be made by the Court or arbitral tribunal (where relevant).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


{:start="13"}
13. Non-compliance will render the CFA void, and solicitors’ fees for any work done will be subject to taxation in the event that the client is successful in the proceedings. However, in these cases, the solicitor will not be entitled to recover any amount in excess of the amount that he would have been entitled to recover, if the CFA had not been void. <sup>[12]</sup>

<ol start="14">
<li><strong>MinLaw seeks your feedback on the proposed conditions/safeguards, including: </strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> <strong>Whether there should be any cap to the “uplift” or “success” fee and if so, what that cap should be and why;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Whether any additional requirements should be imposed; and</strong></li>
<li><strong>The consequences of non-compliance with the requirements.</strong></li>
</ol>
</li> 
</ol>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold;">
<li> PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT RULES</li> 
</ol>


<ol start="15">
<li> In line with the regime applicable to third party funding, MinLaw proposes to impose professional obligations on the conduct of solicitors entering into CFAs with clients. These are:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Disclosure obligations placed on solicitors to disclose the existence of the CFA, to the Court or tribunal (where relevant), and to every other party to those proceedings <sup>[13]</sup>;</li> 
<li>Reinforcing the lawyer’s duty to act in the best interests of his or her client and that the client is to retain control over the conduct of the litigation, including the decision whether to settle <sup>[14]</sup>.</li> 
</ol> 
 
</li>
</ol>


{:start="16"}
16. **MinLaw seeks your feedback on the proposed professional conduct rules, including whether any additional requirements should be imposed.**


<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight: bold;" >
<li>COSTS ORDERS CONSIDERATIONS</li> 
</ol>

{:start="17"}
17. It is proposed that in the event that a successful party in the proceedings has in place a CFA with his solicitor, an order for costs made in the proceedings against the losing party (where relevant) shall not include any part of the success or uplift fee which the successful party may have to pay to his solicitor under the CFA.<sup>[15]</sup>


<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-roman; font-weight:bold;">
<li><u>INVITATION FOR VIEWS AND FEEDBACK</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="18"}
18. Interested persons are invited to provide comments and feedback on the proposed framework for CFAs.  Please note that the final framework may differ substantially from the current proposal. We also welcome any other comments or suggestions.

<sup>[3]</sup>The Right Honourable Lord Justice Jackson (May 2009) “Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Preliminary Report” Volume One, Page 166, Paragraph 1.5  
<sup>[4]</sup> “Maintenance” can be defined as officious intermeddling in litigation, while “champerty” is a particular form of maintenance where one party agrees to aid another to bring a claim on the basis that the person who gives the aid shall receive a share of what may be recovered in the action (<i>Law Society of Singapore v Kurubalan s/o Manickam Rengaraju</i> [2013] SGHC 135)  
<sup>[5]</sup>Section 58(3)(a) of the UK Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 (“UK CLSA”) and Clause 25(3)(c), Schedule 3 of the Legal Practitioners Act 1981 (South Australia, which is similar to legislation in other Australian states such as Victoria and New South Wales) (“South Australian LPA”).  
<sup>[6]</sup>Recommendation by the Committee to Develop the Singapore Legal Sector in their September 2007 Report, adopting recommendations in a paper by the Law Reform and Revision Division, AGC, <i>Proposal to Allow Conditional Fees in Singapore</i> (2004).

<sup>[8]</sup>Clause 25(3)(e), Schedule 3 of the South Australian LPA

<sup>[11]</sup>Clause 26(3), Schedule 3 of the South Australian LPA  
<sup>[12]</sup>Clause 29, Schedule 3 of the South Australian LPA  
<sup>[13]</sup>This disclosure requirement is similar to that under the third party funding framework (Rule 49, Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015), as a safeguard against the potential conflict of interest that may arise when there is a CFA.  
<sup>[14]</sup>Recommendation by the Committee to Develop the Singapore Legal Sector (<i>supra</i> note 6).  
<sup>[15]</sup>Section 58A(6) of the UK CLSA, and recommended by the Committee to Develop the Singapore Legal Sector (<i>supra</i> note 6)
